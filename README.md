# Heroku Buildpack: Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python)

This is the official [Heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for Python apps.

Recommended web frameworks include **Django** and **Flask**, among others. The recommended webserver is **Gunicorn**. There are no restrictions around what software can be used (as long as it's pip-installable). Web processes must bind to `$PORT`, and only the HTTP protocol is permitted for incoming connections.

Python packages with C dependencies that are not [available on the stack image](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack-packages) are generally not supported, unless `manylinux` wheels are provided by the package maintainers (common). For recommended solutions, check out [this article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-c-deps) for more information.

A `requirements.txt` must be present at the root of your application's repository to deploy.

To specify your python version, you also need a `runtime.txt` file - unless you are using the default Python runtime version.

Current default Python Runtime: Python 3.6.12

Alternatively, you can provide a `setup.py` file, or a `Pipfile`.
Using `pipenv` will generate `runtime.txt` at build time if one of the field `python_version` or `python_full_version` is specified in the `requires` section of your `Pipfile`.

Specify a Buildpack Version
---------------------------

You can specify the latest production release of this buildpack for upcoming builds of an existing application:

    $ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python


Specify a Python Runtime
------------------------

Supported runtime options include:

- `python-3.8.5`
- `python-3.7.9`
- `python-3.6.12`
- `python-2.7.18`

## Tests

The buildpack tests use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to simulate
Heroku's [stack images.](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack)

To run the test suite against the default stack:

```
make test
```

Or to test against a particular stack:

```
make test STACK=heroku-16
```

To run only a subset of the tests:

```
make test TEST_CMD=tests/versions
```

The tests are run via the vendored
[shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2)
test framework.
