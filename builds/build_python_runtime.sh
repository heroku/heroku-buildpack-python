# The `make install` step automatically generates `.pyc` files for the stdlib, however:

#   must use one of the hash-based invalidation modes to prevent the `.pyc`s from
#   always being treated as outdated and so being regenerated at application boot.
# - It generates `.pyc`s for all three optimisation levels (standard, -O and -OO),
#   when the vast majority of apps only use the standard mode. As such, we can skip
#   regenerating/shipping those `.opt-{1,2}.pyc` files, reducing build output by 18MB.
