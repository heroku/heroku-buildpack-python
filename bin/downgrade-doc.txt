        Unfortunately, this version won't work on this stack (Heroku-18) as-is.

        You can downgrade to the heroku-16 stack to continue to deploy Python 2.7,
        and for older legacy versions, you can downgrade to cedar-14 stack.

        You can downgrade the stack of an existing app with the following command:
        heroku stack:set heroku-16 --app <myapp>
        To rebuild without a new code commit, run:
        git commit --allow-empty -m \"Downgrading to heroku-16\"

        You can also specify the stack explicitly when creating a new app:
        heroku create --remote <mynewapp> --stack heroku-16

        To use an older tagged version of the python buildpack, run:
        heroku create --remote <mynewapp> --stack heroku-16 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python#v000

        For more information, check out this article about upgrading and downgrading
        your Heroku stack:

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        While it's relatively easy to spin up an app on an older stack, we are 
        constantly improving our stacks, and release new stacks every two years.
        Downgrading should ultimately be considered a temporary solution.

        To downgrade your stack:
