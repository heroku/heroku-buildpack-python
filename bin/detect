Error: Your app is configured to use the Python buildpack,
but we couldn't find any supported Python project files.

A Python app on Heroku must have either a 'requirements.txt' or
'Pipfile' package manager file in the root directory of its
source code.

Currently the root directory of your app contains:

$(ls -1 --indicator-style=slash "${BUILD_DIR}" || true)

If your app already has a package manager file, check that it:

1. Is in the top level directory (not a subdirectory).
2. Has the correct spelling (the filenames are case-sensitive).
3. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.

Otherwise, add a package manager file to your app. If your app has
no dependencies, then create an empty 'requirements.txt' file.
