See docs/index.txt for user documentation.

Contributor notes
-----------------

* virtualenv is designed to work on python 2 and 3 with a single code base. 
  Use Python 3 print-function syntax, and always use sys.exc_info()[1]
  inside the `except` block to get at exception objects.

* virtualenv uses git-flow_ to `coordinate development`_.
