#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script was created by the Python buildpack to automatically set the `WEB_CONCURRENCY`
# environment variable at dyno boot (if it's not already set), based on the available memory
# and number of CPU cores. The env var is then used by some Python web servers (such as
# gunicorn and uvicorn) to control the default number of server processes that they launch.
#
# The default `WEB_CONCURRENCY` value is calculated as the lowest of either:
# - `<number of dyno CPU cores> * 2 + 1`
# - `<dyno available RAM in MB> / 256` (to ensure each process has at least 256 MB RAM)
#
# Currently, on Heroku dynos this results in the following concurrency values:
# - Eco / Basic / Standard-1X: 2 (capped by the 512 MB available memory)
# - Standard-2X / Private-S / Shield-S: 4 (capped by the 1 GB available memory)
# - Performance-M / Private-M / Shield-M: 5 (based on the 2 CPU cores)
# - Performance-L / Private-L / Shield-L: 17 (based on the 8 CPU cores)
# - Performance-L-RAM / Private-L-RAM / Shield-L-RAM: 9 (based on the 4 CPU cores)
# - Performance-XL / Private-XL / Shield-XL: 17 (based on the 8 CPU cores)
# - Performance-2XL / Private-2XL / Shield-2XL: 33 (based on the 16 CPU cores)
#
# To override these default values, either set `WEB_CONCURRENCY` as an explicit config var
# on the app, or pass `--workers <num>` when invoking gunicorn/uvicorn in your Procfile.

# Note: Since this is a .profile.d/ script it will be sourced, meaning that we cannot enable
# exit on error, have to use return not exit, and returning non-zero doesn't have an effect.
