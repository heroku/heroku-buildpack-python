=======

------
0.6.32
------

* Fix test suite with Python 2.6.
* Fix some DeprecationWarnings and ResourceWarnings.
* Issue #335: Backed out `setup_requires` superceding installed requirements
  until regression can be addressed.

------
0.6.31
------

* Issue #303: Make sure the manifest only ever contains UTF-8 in Python 3.
* Issue #329: Properly close files created by tests for compatibility with
  Jython.
* Work around Jython bugs `#1980 <http://bugs.jython.org/issue1980>`_ and
  `#1981 <http://bugs.jython.org/issue1981>`_.
* Issue #334: Provide workaround for packages that reference `sys.__stdout__`
  such as numpy does. This change should address
  `virtualenv #359 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/359>`_ as long
  as the system encoding is UTF-8 or the IO encoding is specified in the
  environment, i.e.::

     PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 pip install numpy

* Fix for encoding issue when installing from Windows executable on Python 3.
* Issue #323: Allow `setup_requires` requirements to supercede installed
  requirements. Added some new keyword arguments to existing pkg_resources
  methods. Also had to updated how __path__ is handled for namespace packages
  to ensure that when a new egg distribution containing a namespace package is
  placed on sys.path, the entries in __path__ are found in the same order they
  would have been in had that egg been on the path when pkg_resources was
  first imported.

------
0.6.30
------

* Issue #328: Clean up temporary directories in distribute_setup.py.
* Fix fatal bug in distribute_setup.py.

------
0.6.29
------

* Pull Request #14: Honor file permissions in zip files.
* Issue #327: Merged pull request #24 to fix a dependency problem with pip.
* Merged pull request #23 to fix https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/301.
* If Sphinx is installed, the `upload_docs` command now runs `build_sphinx`
  to produce uploadable documentation.
* Issue #326: `upload_docs` provided mangled auth credentials under Python 3.
* Issue #320: Fix check for "createable" in distribute_setup.py.
* Issue #305: Remove a warning that was triggered during normal operations.
* Issue #311: Print metadata in UTF-8 independent of platform.
* Issue #303: Read manifest file with UTF-8 encoding under Python 3.
* Issue #301: Allow to run tests of namespace packages when using 2to3.
* Issue #304: Prevent import loop in site.py under Python 3.3.
* Issue #283: Reenable scanning of `*.pyc` / `*.pyo` files on Python 3.3.
* Issue #299: The develop command didn't work on Python 3, when using 2to3,
  as the egg link would go to the Python 2 source. Linking to the 2to3'd code
  in build/lib makes it work, although you will have to rebuild the module
  before testing it.
* Issue #306: Even if 2to3 is used, we build in-place under Python 2.
* Issue #307: Prints the full path when .svn/entries is broken.
* Issue #313: Support for sdist subcommands (Python 2.7)

* Issue #310: Non-ascii characters in a namespace __init__.py causes errors.
* Issue #218: Improved documentation on behavior of `package_data` and
  `include_package_data`. Files indicated by `package_data` are now included
  in the manifest.
* `distribute_setup.py` now allows a `--download-base` argument for retrieving
  distribute from a specified location.

  http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/source/detail?spec=svn875&r=719
  and determined that it no longer applies. Distribute should work fine with
