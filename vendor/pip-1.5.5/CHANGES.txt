  colorama==0.3.1, setuptools==3.4.4).


**1.5.4 (2014-02-21)**


* Correct deprecation warning for ``pip install --build`` to only notify when
  the `--build` value is different than the default.


**1.5.3 (2014-02-20)**


* **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now
  deprecated.  See Issue #906 for discussion.

* Fixed #1112. Couldn't download directly from wheel paths/urls, and when wheel
  downloads did occur using requirement specifiers, dependencies weren't
  downloaded (PR #1527)

* Fixed #1320. ``pip wheel`` was not downloading wheels that already existed (PR
  #1524)

* Fixed #1111. ``pip install --download`` was failing using local

  part of the URL in a requirements file


**1.5.1 (2014-01-20)**


* pip now only requires setuptools (any setuptools, not a certain version) when
  installing distributions from src (i.e. not from wheel). (Pull #1434).

* `get-pip.py` now installs setuptools, when it's not already installed (Pull
  #1475)

* Don't decode downloaded files that have a ``Content-Encoding`` header. (Pull
  #1435)

* Fix to correctly parse wheel filenames with single digit versions. (Pull
  #1445)

* If `--allow-unverified` is used assume it also means `--allow-external`. (Pull
  #1457)


**1.5 (2014-01-01)**


* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer supports the ``--use-mirrors``,
  ``-M``, and ``--mirrors`` flags. The mirroring support has been removed. In
  order to use a mirror specify it as the primary index with ``-i`` or
  ``--index-url``, or as an additional index with ``--extra-index-url``. (Pull #1098, CVE-2013-5123)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer will scrape insecure external urls by
  default nor will it install externally hosted files by default. Users may opt
  into installing externally hosted or insecure files or urls using

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer respects dependency links by default.
  Users may opt into respecting them again using ``--process-dependency-links``.

  unintentionally broke in v0.8.3 when fixing Issue #14 (Pull #1352).

* Fixed a bug where global scripts were being removed when uninstalling --user
  installed packages (Pull #1353).

* Fixed #219, error when using --log with a failed install (Pull #1205).

* Fixed #1131, logging was buffered and choppy in Python 3.

* Fixed #70,  --timeout was being ignored (Pull #1202).

* Fixed #772, error when setting PIP_EXISTS_ACTION (Pull #1201).

* Added colors to the logging output in order to draw attention to important
  warnings and errors. (Pull #1109)

* Added warnings when using an insecure index, find-link, or dependency link. (Pull #1121)

* Added support for installing packages from a subdirectory using the ``subdirectory``
  editable option. ( Pull #1082 )

* Fixed #1192. "TypeError: bad operand type for unary" in some cases when
  installing wheels using --find-links (Pull #1218).

* Fixed #1133 and #317. Archive contents are now written based on system
  defaults and umask (i.e. permissions are not preserved), except that regular
  files with any execute permissions have the equivalent of "chmod +x" applied
  after being written (Pull #1146).

* PreviousBuildDirError now returns a non-zero exit code and prevents the
  previous build dir from being cleaned in all cases (Pull #1162).

* Renamed --allow-insecure to --allow-unverified, however the old name will
  continue to work for a period of time (Pull #1257).

* Fixed #1006, error when installing local projects with symlinks in
  Python 3. (Pull #1311)

* The previously hidden ``--log-file`` otion, is now shown as a general option.
  (Pull #1316)


**1.4.1 (2013-08-07)**


* **New Signing Key** Release 1.4.1 is using a different key than normal with
  fingerprint: 7C6B 7C5D 5E2B 6356 A926 F04F 6E3C BCE9 3372 DCFA

**1.4 (2013-07-23)**


* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip now only installs stable versions by default,
  and offers a new ``--pre`` option to also find pre-release and development
  versions. (Pull #834)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum
  supported Python version for pip 1.4 is Python 2.6.

* Added support for installing and building wheel archives.
  Thanks Daniel Holth, Marcus Smith, Paul Moore, and Michele Lacchia
  (Pull #845)

* Applied security patch to pip's ssl support related to certificate DNS
  wildcard matching (http://bugs.python.org/issue17980).

* To satisfy pip's setuptools requirement, pip now recommends setuptools>=0.8,
  not distribute. setuptools and distribute are now merged into one project
  called 'setuptools'. (Pull #1003)

* pip will now warn when installing a file that is either hosted externally to
  the index or cannot be verified with a hash. In the future pip will default
  to not installing them and will require the flags --allow-external NAME, and
  --allow-insecure NAME respectively. (Pull #985)

* If an already-downloaded or cached file has a bad hash, re-download it rather
  than erroring out. (Issue #963).

* ``pip bundle`` and support for installing from pybundle files is now
  considered deprecated and will be removed in pip v1.5.

* Fixed a number of issues (#413, #709, #634, #602, and #939) related to
  cleaning up and not reusing build directories. (Pull #865, #948)

  Thanks Hugo Lopes Tavares and Kelsey Hightower (Pull #872).

* "Vendorized" distlib as pip.vendor.distlib (https://distlib.readthedocs.org/).

* Fixed git VCS backend with git 1.8.3. (Pull #967)


**1.3.1 (2013-03-08)**

* Improvements to sphinx docs and cli help. (Pull #773)

* Fixed issue #707, dealing with OS X temp dir handling, which was causing
  global NumPy installs to fail. (Pull #768)

  of a package is found under 2 different URLs.  Thanks Paul Moore (Pull #671)

* Fix git submodule recursive updates.  Thanks Roey Berman. (Pulls #674)

* Explicitly ignore rel='download' links while looking for html pages.
  Thanks Maxime R. (Pull #677)

* --user/--upgrade install options now work together. Thanks 'eevee' for
  discovering the problem. (Pull #705)

* Added check in ``install --download`` to prevent re-downloading if the target
  file already exists. Thanks Andrey Bulgakov. (Pull #669)

* Added support for bare paths (including relative paths) as argument to
  `--find-links`. Thanks Paul Moore for draft patch.

* Added support for --no-index in requirements files.

* Added "pip show" command to get information about an installed package.
  Fixes #131. Thanks Kelsey Hightower and Rafael Caricio.

* Added `--root` option for "pip install" to specify root directory. Behaves
  like the same option in distutils but also plays nice with pip's egg-info.
  Thanks Przemek Wrzos.  (Issue #253 / Pull #693)


**1.2.1 (2012-09-06)**


* Fixed a regression introduced in 1.2 about raising an exception when
  not finding any files to uninstall in the current environment. Thanks for
  the fix, Marcus Smith.


**1.2 (2012-09-01)**


* **Dropped support for Python 2.4** The minimum supported Python version is
  now Python 2.5.

* Fixed issue #605 - pypi mirror support broken on some DNS responses. Thanks
  philwhin.

* Fixed issue #355 - pip uninstall removes files it didn't install. Thanks
  pjdelport.

  andreigc.

* Pull in submodules for git editable checkouts. Fixes #289 and #421. Thanks
  Hsiaoming Yang and Markus Hametner.

* Use a temporary directory as the default build location outside of a
  virtualenv. Fixes issues #339 and #381. Thanks Ben Rosser.

* Added support for specifying extras with local editables. Thanks Nick
  Stenning.

* Added ``--egg`` flag to request egg-style rather than flat installation. Refs
  issue #3. Thanks Kamal Bin Mustafa.

* Fixed issue #510 - prevent e.g. ``gmpy2-2.0.tar.gz`` from matching a request
  to ``pip install gmpy``; sdist filename must begin with full project name
  followed by a dash. Thanks casevh for the report.

* Fixed issue #504 - allow package URLS to have querystrings. Thanks W.
  Trevor King.

* Fixed issue #58 - pip freeze now falls back to non-editable format rather
  than blowing up if it can't determine the origin repository of an editable.
  Thanks Rory McCann.

* Added a `__main__.py` file to enable `python -m pip` on Python versions
  that support it. Thanks Alexey Luchko.

* Fixed issue #487 - upgrade from VCS url of project that does exist on
  index. Thanks Andrew Knapp for the report.

* Fixed issue #486 - fix upgrade from VCS url of project with no distribution
  on index.  Thanks Andrew Knapp for the report.

  Thanks Stavros Korokithakis.

* Added support for authentication with Subversion repositories. Thanks
  Qiangning Hong.

* Fixed issue #315 - ``--download`` now downloads dependencies as well.
  Thanks Qiangning Hong.

* Errors from subprocesses will display the current working directory.
  Thanks Antti Kaihola.

* Fixed issue #369 - compatibility with Subversion 1.7. Thanks Qiangning
  Hong. Note that setuptools remains incompatible with Subversion 1.7; to
  get the benefits of pip's support you must use Distribute rather than
  setuptools.

* Fixed issue #57 - ignore py2app-generated OS X mpkg zip files in finder.
  Thanks Rene Dudfield.

* Fixed issue #182 - log to ~/Library/Logs/ by default on OS X framework
  installs. Thanks Dan Callahan for report and patch.

* Fixed issue #310 - understand version tags without minor version ("py3")
  in sdist filenames. Thanks Stuart Andrews for report and Olivier Girardot for
  patch.

* Fixed issue #7 - Pip now supports optionally installing setuptools
  "extras" dependencies; e.g. "pip install Paste[openid]". Thanks Matt Maker
  and Olivier Girardot.

* Fixed issue #391 - freeze no longer borks on requirements files with
  --index-url or --find-links. Thanks Herbert Pfennig.

* Fixed issue #288 - handle symlinks properly. Thanks lebedov for the patch.

* Fixed issue #49 - pip install -U no longer reinstalls the same versions of
  packages. Thanks iguananaut for the pull request.

* Removed ``-E``/``--environment`` option and ``PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV``;
  both use a restart-in-venv mechanism that's broken, and neither one is
  useful since every virtualenv now has pip inside it.  Replace ``pip -E
  path/to/venv install Foo`` with ``virtualenv path/to/venv &&
  path/to/venv/pip install Foo``.

* Fixed issue #366 - pip throws IndexError when it calls `scraped_rel_links`

* Fixed issue #22 - pip search should set and return a userful shell status code

* Fixed issue #351 and #365 - added global ``--exists-action`` command line
  option to easier script file exists conflicts, e.g. from editable
  requirements from VCS that have a changed repo URL.

  Hightower, and Alex Gronholm, among others.

* Download progress only shown on a real TTY. Thanks Alex Morega.

* Fixed finding of VCS binaries to not be fooled by same-named directories.
  Thanks Alex Morega.

* Fixed uninstall of packages from system Python for users of Debian/Ubuntu
  python-setuptools package (workaround until fixed in Debian and Ubuntu).

* Added `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
  installer. Simply download and execute it, using the Python interpreter of
  your choice::

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
    $ python get-pip.py

  This may have to be run as root.

  .. note::

      Make sure you have `distribute <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_
      installed before using the installer!

* Fixed issue #32, #150, #161 - Fixed checking out the correct
  tag/branch/commit when updating an editable Git requirement.

* Fixed issue #49 - Added ability to install version control requirements
  without making them editable, e.g.::

    pip install git+https://github.com/pypa/pip/

* Fixed issue #175 - Correctly locate build and source directory on Mac OS X.

* Added ``git+https://`` scheme to Git VCS backend.


**0.8.1**

  Ronny Pfannschmidt.

* Added support for `PyPI mirrors <http://pypi.python.org/mirrors>`_ as
  defined in `PEP 381 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0381/>`_, from

**0.8**


* Track which ``build/`` directories pip creates, never remove directories
  it doesn't create.  From Hugo Lopes Tavares.

* Pip now accepts file:// index URLs. Thanks Dave Abrahams.

* Various cleanup to make test-running more consistent and less fragile.
  Thanks Dave Abrahams.

* Real Windows support (with passing tests). Thanks Dave Abrahams.

* ``pip-2.7`` etc. scripts are created (Python-version specific scripts)

* ``contrib/build-standalone`` script creates a runnable ``.zip`` form of
  pip, from Jannis Leidel

* Editable git repos are updated when reinstalled

* Fix problem with ``--editable`` when multiple ``.egg-info/`` directories
  are found.

  installing bundles, also from Alex Conrad.

* Tests now require at least ScriptTest 1.0.3.


**0.7**


* Fixed uninstallation on Windows
* Added ``pip search`` command.
* Tab-complete names of installed distributions for ``pip uninstall``.
* Support tab-completion when there is a global-option before the
  subcommand.
* Install header files in standard (scheme-default) location when installing
  outside a virtualenv. Install them to a slightly more consistent
  non-standard location inside a virtualenv (since the standard location is
  a non-writable symlink to the global location).
* pip now logs to a central location by default (instead of creating
  ``pip-log.txt`` all over the place) and constantly overwrites the
  file in question. On Unix and Mac OS X this is ``'$HOME/.pip/pip.log'``
  and on Windows it's ``'%HOME%\\pip\\pip.log'``. You are still able to
  override this location with the ``$PIP_LOG_FILE`` environment variable.
  For a complete (appended) logfile use the separate ``'--log'`` command line
  option.
* Fixed an issue with Git that left an editable packge as a checkout of a
  remote branch, even if the default behaviour would have been fine, too.
* Fixed installing from a Git tag with older versions of Git.
* Expand "~" in logfile and download cache paths.
* Speed up installing from Mercurial repositories by cloning without
  updating the working copy multiple times.

  ``pip install path/to/dir/``).
* Fixed installing editable packages with ``svn+ssh`` URLs.
* Don't print unwanted debug information when running the freeze command.
* Create log file directory automatically. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
* Make test suite easier to run successfully. Thanks Dave Abrahams.
* Fixed "pip install ." and "pip install .."; better error for directory
  without setup.py. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
* Support Debian/Ubuntu "dist-packages" in zip command. Thanks duckx.
* Fix relative --src folder. Thanks Simon Cross.
* Handle missing VCS with an error message. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
* Added --no-download option to install; pairs with --no-install to separate
  download and installation into two steps. Thanks Simon Cross.
* Fix uninstalling from requirements file containing -f, -i, or
  --extra-index-url.
* Leftover build directories are now removed. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.


**0.6.3**


* Fixed import error on Windows with regard to the backwards compatibility
  package


**0.6.2**

* Fixed an issue in the package finder that could result in an
  infinite loop while looking for links.

* Fixed issue with ``pip bundle`` and local files (which weren't being
  copied into the bundle), from Whit Morriss.


**0.6**


* Add ``pip uninstall`` and uninstall-before upgrade (from Carl
  Meyer).

* Extended configurability with config files and environment variables.

* Allow packages to be upgraded, e.g., ``pip install Package==0.1``
  then ``pip install Package==0.2``.

* Allow installing/upgrading to Package==dev (fix "Source version does not
  match target version" errors).

* Added command and option completion for bash and zsh.

* Extended integration with virtualenv by providing an option to
  automatically use an active virtualenv and an option to warn if no active
  virtualenv is found.

* Fixed a bug with pip install --download and editable packages, where
  directories were being set with 0000 permissions, now defaults to 755.

* Fixed uninstallation of easy_installed console_scripts.

* Fixed uninstallation on Mac OS X Framework layout installs

* Fixed bug preventing uninstall of editables with source outside venv.

* Creates download cache directory if not existing.


**0.5.1**


* Fixed a couple little bugs, with git and with extensions.


**0.5**


* Added ability to override the default log file name (``pip-log.txt``)
  with the environmental variable ``$PIP_LOG_FILE``.

* Made the freeze command print installed packages to stdout instead of
  writing them to a file. Use simple redirection (e.g.
  ``pip freeze > stable-req.txt``) to get a file with requirements.

* Fixed problem with freezing editable packages from a Git repository.

* Added support for base URLs using ``<base href='...'>`` when parsing
  HTML pages.

* Fixed installing of non-editable packages from version control systems.

* Fixed issue with Bazaar's bzr+ssh scheme.

* Added --download-dir option to the install command to retrieve package
  archives. If given an editable package it will create an archive of it.

* Added ability to pass local file and directory paths to ``--find-links``,
  e.g. ``--find-links=file:///path/to/my/private/archive``

* Reduced the amount of console log messages when fetching a page to find a
  distribution was problematic. The full messages can be found in pip-log.txt.

* Added ``--no-deps`` option to install ignore package dependencies

* Added ``--no-index`` option to ignore the package index (PyPI) temporarily

* Fixed installing editable packages from Git branches.

* Fixes freezing of editable packages from Mercurial repositories.

* Fixed handling read-only attributes of build files, e.g. of Subversion and
  Bazaar on Windows.

* When downloading a file from a redirect, use the redirected
  location's extension to guess the compression (happens specifically
  when redirecting to a bitbucket.org tip.gz file).

* Editable freeze URLs now always use revision hash/id rather than tip or
  branch names which could move.

* Fixed comparison of repo URLs so incidental differences such as
  presence/absence of final slashes or quoted/unquoted special
  characters don't trigger "ignore/switch/wipe/backup" choice.

* Fixed handling of attempt to checkout editable install to a
  non-empty, non-repo directory.


**0.4**


* Make ``-e`` work better with local hg repositories

* Construct PyPI URLs the exact way easy_install constructs URLs (you
  might notice this if you use a custom index that is
  slash-sensitive).

* Improvements on Windows (from `Ionel Maries Cristian
  <http://ionelmc.wordpress.com/>`_).

* Fixed problem with not being able to install private git repositories.

* Make ``pip zip`` zip all its arguments, not just the first.

* Fix some filename issues on Windows.

  virtualenv is to be created.

* Fixed support for Subversion 1.6.


**0.3.1**


* Improved virtualenv restart and various path/cleanup problems on win32.

* Fixed a regression with installing from svn repositories (when not
  using ``-e``).

* Fixes when installing editable packages that put their source in a
  subdirectory (like ``src/``).

* Improve ``pip -h``


**0.3**


* Added support for editable packages created from Git, Mercurial and Bazaar
  repositories and ability to freeze them. Refactored support for version
  control systems.

* Do not use ``sys.exit()`` from inside the code, instead use a
  return.  This will make it easier to invoke programmatically.

* Put the install record in ``Package.egg-info/installed-files.txt``
  (previously they went in
  ``site-packages/install-record-Package.txt``).

* Fix a problem with ``pip freeze`` not including ``-e svn+`` when an
  svn structure is peculiar.

* Allow ``pip -E`` to work with a virtualenv that uses a different
  version of Python than the parent environment.

* Fixed Win32 virtualenv (``-E``) option.

* Search the links passed in with ``-f`` for packages.

* Detect zip files, even when the file doesn't have a ``.zip``
  extension and it is served with the wrong Content-Type.

* Installing editable from existing source now works, like ``pip
  install -e some/path/`` will install the package in ``some/path/``.
  Most importantly, anything that package requires will also be
  installed by pip.

* Add a ``--path`` option to ``pip un/zip``, so you can avoid zipping
  files that are outside of where you expect.

* Add ``--simulate`` option to ``pip zip``.


**0.2.1**


* Fixed small problem that prevented using ``pip.py`` without actually
  installing pip.

* Fixed ``--upgrade``, which would download and appear to install
  upgraded packages, but actually just reinstall the existing package.

* Fixed Windows problem with putting the install record in the right
  place, and generating the ``pip`` script with Setuptools.

* Download links that include embedded spaces or other unsafe
  characters (those characters get %-encoded).

* Fixed use of URLs in requirement files, and problems with some blank
  lines.

* Turn some tar file errors into warnings.


**0.2**


* Renamed to ``pip``, and to install you now do ``pip install
  PACKAGE``

* Added command ``pip zip PACKAGE`` and ``pip unzip PACKAGE``.  This
  is particularly intended for Google App Engine to manage libraries
  to stay under the 1000-file limit.

* Some fixes to bundles, especially editable packages and when
  creating a bundle using unnamed packages (like just an svn
  repository without ``#egg=Package``).


**0.1.4**


* Added an option ``--install-option`` to pass options to pass
  arguments to ``setup.py install``

* ``.svn/`` directories are no longer included in bundles, as these
  directories are specific to a version of svn -- if you build a
  bundle on a system with svn 1.5, you can't use the checkout on a
  system with svn 1.4.  Instead a file ``svn-checkout.txt`` is
  included that notes the original location and revision, and the
  command you can use to turn it back into an svn checkout.  (Probably
  unpacking the bundle should, maybe optionally, recreate this
  information -- but that is not currently implemented, and it would
  require network access.)

* Avoid ambiguities over project name case, where for instance
  MyPackage and mypackage would be considered different packages.
  This in particular caused problems on Macs, where ``MyPackage/`` and
  ``mypackage/`` are the same directory.

* Added support for an environmental variable
  ``$PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` which will cache package downloads, so
  future installations won't require large downloads.  Network access
  is still required, but just some downloads will be avoided when
  using this.


**0.1.3**


* Always use ``svn checkout`` (not ``export``) so that
  ``tag_svn_revision`` settings give the revision of the package.

* Don't update checkouts that came from ``.pybundle`` files.


**0.1.2**


* Improve error text when there are errors fetching HTML pages when
  seeking packages.

* Improve bundles: include empty directories, make them work with
  editable packages.

* If you use ``-E env`` and the environment ``env/`` doesn't exist, a
  new virtual environment will be created.

* Fix ``dependency_links`` for finding packages.


**0.1.1**


* Fixed a NameError exception when running pip outside of a
  virtualenv environment.

* Added HTTP proxy support (from Prabhu Ramachandran)

* Fixed use of ``hashlib.md5`` on python2.5+ (also from Prabhu
  Ramachandran)


**0.1**


* Initial release
